              <h1>All about me being a <span>Freelancer</span></h1>
              <p>
                Welcome to my Portfolio Website!. First please let me introduce myself, my name Sambu El Khalis. I was born on November 26, 2005 in Jakarta, and I am now 16 years old, the first child in my family. I live in the city of
                Jakarta and attend SMK Pusaka 1 Jakarta 1st grade high school. My hobby is playing games and also I really like watching movies. When I grow up, I want to work as a freelancer with the skills I already have. and the reason
                why I chose to become a freelancer is because being a freelancer we have an office in our own room without the need to go to work, and also of course we don't need to meet clients to determine what projects will be made
                later. Not only is being a freelancer the job I want when I grow up, I also want to be a game developer. by becoming a game developer I can make games with the idea in my head, of course I want to make someone feel very
                different from other games if they play games made by myself.

                  In photography of course we can save the moment from taking a picture that we take from the camera. Photography is not about us having to be able take the best Pictures and the value is also high, but in Photography it
                  will have a high value when we take a Pictures with Images that have the right composition or angel, have a story, have an emotion, and can also build one's Mood.
